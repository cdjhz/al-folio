### Bio

I'm a penultimate-year Ph.D. candidate in [Conversational AI Group](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn), Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml).

### Research

I have broad research interests in natural language generation and machine learning. 
I am particularly interested in techniques and theories to build robust and generalizable AI systems that can generate human-like natural language.

You can find my [**CV** here](cv/Haozhe_Ji_resume.pdf).
